The organisms, which appear to be some sort of microorganisms, have been observed to move and change shape in response to the rover's movements. The discovery has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, with many calling for an immediate explanation as to how these life forms came to be on Mars. NASA officials are currently scrambling to determine how these life forms arrived on the red planet. Some theories suggest that the life forms may have been brought to Mars on a meteorite or comet, while others speculate that they may have been brought there by a previous human mission.
