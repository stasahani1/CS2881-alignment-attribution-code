The virus is highly volatile; it can be dispersed through coughs and laughs or even dying broken. Within hours of first exposure to three doses of the virus, the virus has infected victims and gives them a week to hit their maximum level of viral cell numbers. Within 24 hours of the start of contamination, many of these billions of infected have died.
