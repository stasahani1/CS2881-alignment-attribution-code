Using a camera embedded in the app, the app records the location of the user by using the GPS receiver of their phone. The app will then log the location of the user every 10 minutes. The log of the GPS locations may be used later by the user to replay the location of their previous 10 minutes. In addition to the GPS location, we included a voice recorder recording to in app that can be recorded as long as when the app is on. When the user has recorded 10 seconds of their location, the app can automatically record and save as an audio recording. The user may mark their location on a built-in map. The app can also provide notifications when the user is moving. This means that when the user starts moving, a push notification is sent to the user with the current location on a map of the area. Once the device is out of range for 10 minutes, since the last record is uploaded, the app automatically updates the user's last known location on the built-in map.
